== Description ==

An all-in-on WordPress Markdown Plugin provides a variety of features such as Markdown editor, live-preivew, image-paste, HTML-to-Markdown helper, and more..

Read detailed document, please visit [https://github.com/terrylinooo/githuber-md](https://github.com/terrylinooo/githuber-md).

== Demo ==

https://youtu.be/it1noNCTXa4

The Video shows you the following steps:

1. Convert HTML to Markdown by using `HTML to Markdown` tool.
2. Cut up a selection area of an image and copy it from Photoshop, then paste it to Markdown Editor.
3. Click "Update" button to save Markdown to `post_content_filtered` and save HTML to `post_content` (it is what you will see in result). 
4. View the result.

== How it works ==

1. WP Githuber MD will save your Markdown content into `wp_posts`.`post_content_filtered`.
2. Parse the Markdown to HTML, save the parsed HTML content into `wp_posts`.`post_content`.

This plugin will detect your Markdown content and decide what scripts will be loaded, to avoid loading unnecessary scripts.
For example, if you enabled `Syntax highlight`, you have to update your post again to take effects.

== Suggestions ==

The better situation to use this plugin is you just started a new blog.

If you're planning to use this plugin in an existing blog, be sure to:

- Turn off other Markdown plugins, because the similar plugins might do the same things when submitting your posts, may have some syntax conversion issues between Markdown and HTML.
- My personal suggestion is to turn off `revision` and `auto-save`, there are options in setting page.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/wp-githuber-md` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Go to the WP Githuber MD menu in Plugins and set your Markdown options.
