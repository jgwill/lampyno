[How it works? and examples.](http://tiptoppress.com/template-arrange-post-details/)

For more layout options please try our premium widget: [Term and Category based Posts Widget](http://tiptoppress.com/term-and-category-based-posts-widget/).

= Use SVG icons =
For SVG font-icon HTML we recommend the [WordPress Dashicons](https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons/), which are included as default and can be used without any font-icon including.

= How to use Page Bilder plugins like Divi, SiteOrigin Page Builder or Elementor =
Please read more about Page Builder plugins at our [FAQs](http://tiptoppress.com/faqs/)

= Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_FUNCTION in /home/www/blog/wp-content/plugins/category-posts/cat-posts.php on line 58 =
Some of the features that were used in that version needs PHP 5.3+.
We apologies for any headache this may cause you, but frankly it is better for you to check with your hosting company how can you upgrade the PHP version that you are using, and not only in order to use this plugin. PHP 5.2 should be considered insecure now, and for your own sake you should upgrade.
PHP 5.2 is very old and any support for it from the php developers had ended more then 5 years ago [php.net/eol.php](http://php.net/eol.php).
We know there are peopel how use PHP 5.2 [wordpress.org/about/stats](https://wordpress.org/about/stats/) and we can't imagine this people will have no other problems, if they don't update.

= You check the PHP version with phpversion(), but the widget don't work =
Check also the .htaccess file, if there is an entry for an older PHP version.

= Excerpt length in lines don't work with FireFox and IE =
We use for Excerpt length in lines a CSS feature called "line-clamp" which isn't supported in FireFox and IE at the moment.
But since it is supported by all other browsers, we think it will be supported in FireFox and IE soon.
The FireFox browser has a coverage of 5%, which we find little. For this 5%, we have included a polyfill in our [Excerpt Extension add-on](https://wordpress.org/plugins/excerpt-extension/).

== Screenshots ==
1. Front end of the widget with SVG font-icon support for post formats, hover effects and the Template text-area.
2. Template to arrange the post details with placeholders.
3. Edit the widget options with the customizer.
4. Use shortcode [catposts] in the content.
5. The widget configuration dialog.
6. Widget behaviour settings for each user.
