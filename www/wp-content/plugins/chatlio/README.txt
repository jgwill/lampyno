Chatlio lets you talk with your customers using Slack directly from your WordPress site.

== Description ==

Chatlio is a live chat solution for Slack teams. Visitors to your site see a chat box on their screen and messages are delivered directly to your Slack account. You get all the awesome Slack tools to manage chats and channels along with the immediacy of a live chat, all for the benefit of better customer communication.
